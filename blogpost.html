        <h1>Why Youth of India must join Indian Defence Forces ?</h1>
        <p>Dear Youth of India ! I being a veteran of Indian Navy feel extremely proud, immensely lucky and as a most proud person on earth that I am a part of the great, utmost professional and the best, Indian Armed Forces(IAFs).</p>

        <p>In your life being part of IAFs you look for the best for your self but before that what best you can do for the nation as you become the protector of fellow Indians safeguarding the borders of this great nation. You are awake 24x7 so that the fellow brothers and sisters are with out a fear, trouble free, completely safe & secure so that you do your best what you look for or strive for. Indian Armed Forces are a representation of the inner soul of India where a mini India reside and there is no color, no religion, no caste, no race, no biases, no preferences but you are an Indian to defend the nation as your prime objective so that our nation take big steps towards peace, progress & prosperity always. When nation is traversing this path of success and growth my fellow Indians attain their best in each & every sphere of life what they choose to do in their life.</p>
            
        <p>On this proud day of Indian Independence, 15th Aug 2024 I would like to advise that Indian Youth must join Indian Defence Forces(IDFs) as per your preference or choice or ability for an entry depending your age, qualification and competence as judged in written competitive examination, physical fitness, medical standards and SSB. Even if you are rejected still it make you feel inspired that what it was looking for, so that you do the best in your life. Dr. Abdul Kalam, on being rejected in SSB for becoming an officer in IAFs/IDFs, he rose to become the President of India. There are many such cases where the inspiration was drawn from IDFs that what is needed to become part of elite Indian Defence Forces ( i.e. Indian Army, Indian Navy or Indian Airforce).</p>
            
        <p>Why you, the Youth of India must be inspired I suggest that you must find out the stories of gallantry ward winners for a period before Independence what Indian soldiers did while fighting as part of British Forces around the world during World War-I & II with a velour & bravery , then during 1948 skirmish( a limited war or an undeclared war by the Pakistan in 1948 to take over Kashmir), 1962 war against China at different fronts, 1965 war against Pakistan, 1971 War when Bangladesh was borne and then in Kargil War against Pakistan in 1999. I am sure you will have enough motivation & inspiration to serve mother nation as your best option. Not only that you just listen to audios and watch videos what the soldier did in all these wars and what they are are doing at Siachen where temperature falls minus 70 degree centigrade, in deserts where temperature rise up to 55 degree centigrade and in marshy lands & dense forest areas day & night so that all Indians are secure & safe all the times. How Indian Armed Forces are fighting against insurgency, Pakistan sponsored on going terrorism, China excursion attempts and beside that Indian Armed Forces are there to save lives of Indians in natural calamities. Also, to safe guard other nations as well as becoming an active part of International Peace Keeping Forces and also defending sea routes from sea pirates and houties attacks. You as part of IDFs you get an opportunity to scale mount Everest, fly on heights, sail around the globe, stay in places where no strand of grass or other creature exit there, represent your nation in sports & games at Asia & Global levels in Olympics. So, a completely holistic life full of challenges and enjoyment of over coming them on day to day basis that you cant attain any where.</p>
            
        <p>So, it (IAFs) provides you a service rather a way of life where you become the proudest of your act of doing a great service for your mother land, safeguarding & securing the life of fellow Indians, gain utmost satisfaction on each day, becoming a professional who always succeeds against all odds, becoming confidant that you will always deliver, a life full of adventure and enjoyment & full of surprises and change in place of serving, and make your children & family the same way as most rounded to the ground, robust to succeed, a team builder & as part of team as to become the best example for the society with the complete honesty, dedication, commitment, courage & conviction. You work for Naam, Nishan & Namak.</p>
            
        <p>There is no other real hero's, no celebrity and no other service that provided you an inspiration and that satisfaction as real Heros of Indian Armed Forces. So, be part of it. Do'not get in to that what entry you are joining as some politician do confuse you in order to gain some political advantages by distracting you as talking about Short Service Commission Officers and Agnipath Entry. You will realise that on selection when you pass out from any training academy of Indian Armed Forces in any wing i.e. Army, Navy or Airforce you will find that you are a totally a changed person, as highly disciplined, focused, found purpose in life, attaining the best of qualities that are needed in each walk of life or in jobs streams at any level globally, that are honesty to the purpose, loyalty, serving with best of capabilities , always empower yourself with on going learning & skilling in a pursuit to do the best in life, adventurous so take on risks in calculated way, and a zeal to move in achieving objectives against all odds and in a given time frame. So, you are a performer who delivers consistently and do the best for your self, organization, family & for the society and for the nation.</p>
            
        <p>So, all the best and a very happy independence day to all the Youth of India and once again I advise that you must join Indian Defence Forces in any capacity as you are entitled for or applicable. I am most proud that one of my two sons joined Indian Navy and serving my great nation Bharat. I feel that even his son shall be doing the same. It is an honor and unparallel as to be the part of Indian Defence Forces.</p>
